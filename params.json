The only thing you'll need to learn is how to upload files to your server (here's how to do it in 5 minutes: [FTP guide]({{ blog url }}ftp-guide)).\r\n\r\nYou will also want to check out how **[Markdown]({{ blog url }}markdown-guide)** works so you can add images, titles, bold text and make your site look pretty and fancy (You can write HTML too).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow tiny is SlickCMS?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nSlickCMS is extremely tiny weighting less than 0.1MB. This site you are seeing right now is using SlickCMS.

It is a great option for cheap servers and old computers. And also if you want to run hundreds of blogs without compromising your CPU.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
